This project utilizes Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create a database within Microsoft Excel. A user form is designed to facilitate tenant identification and manage data interactions.

Project Overview:

This project utilizes Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to create a database within Microsoft Excel. A user form is designed to facilitate tenant identification and manage data interactions.

Key Features:

User Form Interface:
The project involves designing a user form interface using VBA within Excel.
The user form serves as the primary interface for tenant identification and data management.
Database Management:
The user form interacts with an Excel worksheet acting as a database.
Data is pushed to and pulled from the database based on user inputs and actions.
Functionality:

Tenant Identification:
Users can enter tenant information (e.g., name, slip size, tenant ID) into the user form.
The user form provides features to search for tenants based on their ID and display relevant data.
Data Interaction:
Data entered into the user form is stored and managed within an Excel worksheet.
The user form allows for adding new tenant records, searching for existing records, and displaying associated data.
Project Components:

User Form Design:
Creation of a user-friendly interface using VBA user forms.
Integration of text boxes, command buttons, and image display for tenant identification.
Database Implementation:
Utilization of Excel worksheets to store tenant data.
Implementation of VBA macros to interact with the database (e.g., save, search, retrieve data).
Development Process:

VBA Coding:
Writing VBA code to handle user form events (e.g., button clicks, form initialization).
Implementing data validation and error handling to ensure robust functionality.
Testing and Debugging:
Iterative testing of the user form to validate data input and database interactions.
Debugging and refining the VBA code to optimize performance and usability.
Project Goals:

Develop a user-friendly database management system using VBA and Excel.
Enhance tenant identification and data retrieval processes through the user form interface.
Ensure reliability and efficiency of the application for seamless data handling and user interaction.
